# Express_Lab


This is a demonstration of a very basic express application.

I used pug to create four different views.  There are navigation buttons at the bottom, and each view is styled from a stylesheet in my file structure.

The index view is an intro, contains an img from the public folder with a download button via post request. The name is defaulted to mine from the view

The about view is extremely basic, just to demonstrate changing views with get requests.

The login view allows the user to enter form data, then displays that data in the index page, and redirects them there.

the user page encourages the user to update the url with their name and uses that to populate the page using route parameters.

The console in my terminal on the server also logs timestamps of actions, and the simple "merp" to indicate actions on the server.
